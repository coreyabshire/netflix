Netflix Prize
=============

Netflix Prize competition entry from 2009 by Corey Abshire.

Though I joined rather late in the competition, I had a lot of good
fun learning about recommendation systems and trying to compete. 

A big part of my challenge early on ended up being machine limits:
my computer at the time only had 1GB of RAM, which really wasn't 
enough to run some of the needed algorithms. So much of my time was 
spent wrestling the data into memory.
